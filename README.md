## Motivation
There were a couple of reasons that made me work on this project:
 - Lack of CRUD metafield operations in Shopify dashboard.
 - Most of the Apps that offered this functionality had a very bad user experience and were buggy.
 - ShopifyFD started to had issues due to changes in Shopify Admin and is no longer maintained.
 - On top of all, I personally wanted to develop something that can be used in real world using React to test and polish my skills, without having me to spin up a server or make this a paid Shopify app

## FAQs

### Why not "Shopify Utilities"?
Because the word 'Shopify' is trademarked and the word Poshify is better than Shopify, you bet!

### Can you also add [enter-feature-here] feature?
Open an issue with detailed info and how it can be useful to MOST of the other developers and merchants. If it is worth adding, I might consider it.
