 - [React JSON View](https://github.com/mac-s-g/react-json-view "React JSON View") - JSON viewer for react

## Motivation
There were a couple of reasons that made me work on this project:
 - Lack of CRUD metafield operations in Shopify dashboard.
 - Most of the Apps that offered this functionality had a very bad user experience and were buggy.
 - ShopifyFD started to had issues due to changes in Shopify Admin.
 - On top of all, I personally wanted to develop something that can be used in real world using React to test and polish my skills, without having me to spin up a server or make this a paid Shopify app

(I just learnt that I can't make this a paid Shopify app anyway (or any paid Shopify app) because Shopify only uses PayPal for partner payouts and PayPal is not supported in my country üòî)

## Inspiration
The project is highly inspired by [ShopifyFD](https://github.com/freakdesign/shopifyFD "Shopify FD").
