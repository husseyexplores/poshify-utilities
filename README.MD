## FAQs

### Why not "Shopify Utilities"?
Because the word 'Shopify' is trademarked and the word Poshify is better than Shopify, you bet!

### Can you also add [enter-feature-here] feature?
Open an issue with detailed info and how it can be useful to MOST of the other developers and merchants. If it is worth adding, I might consider it.
